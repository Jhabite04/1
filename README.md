# Preyground

1 lair to protect, where the mighty beasts rest,
3 paths lead through the jungle, each a test.
Guardians of the wild, fierce and bold,
Intellect and instincts are carefully controlled.
Animals of power, each with their might,
Navigate the board and prepare for the fight.
Thrilling adventures await, let the game ignite!

### Rules




### Gameplay
1. Each player takes turn moving one piece, usually one tile horizontally or vertically.
2. Capturing occurs if you move a piece onto a space that contains an opponent's piece. You may only do this if your piece is of a higher or equal rank with that piece. When a piece is captured, it is removed from the game. Some exceptions are covered in the **Pieces** section.
3. An *amphibious* piece may move onto a water tile.
4. If a *flying* piece is adjacent to a water tile, it may move in that direction, flying over to the closest non-water tile.
5. A piece cannot capture a piece that is on a water tile. A piece on a water tile cannot capture.
6. If your piece is in the opponent's trap (next to their lair), it cannot capture anything, is capturable by anything and loses its abilities.
7. You cannot move pieces into your own lair.
